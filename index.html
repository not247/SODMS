        <h2>Current Status and Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
            At present, i am seeking assist in establishing a company, developing an online presence, handling marketing, addressing legal issues, and securing investors. These efforts are aimed at making this solution widely available to everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that investment is needed for the aforementioned aspects, not for app development. The APP already exists as a working product - simple, easy to use, and minimalist in design.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I do not have extensive business experience in bringing a product to market, I am committed to the success of this product. I am actively seeking investors, legal and marketing expertise, and any other necessary support to make this a reality. To reiterate, we have a fully functional, working product ready for the market.
        </p>

        <li>Personal journal or confidential notes</li>
        <li>Medical records</li>
        <li>Business trade secrets or intellectual property</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced protection against network-based threats</li>
        <li>Resilience against device loss, theft, or failure</li>
        <li>Long-term data preservation capabilities</li>
        <li>Cost-effective redundancy compared to hardware wallets</li>
        <li>Flexibility in storage and backup options</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hardware Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be implemented on smartphones, tablets, PCs, or Macs</li>
        <li>Remove SIM card if using a mobile device</li>
        <li>Disable all wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC)</li>
        <li>If possible, physically remove or disable network hardware</li>
        <li>Ensure the device has never been and will never be connected to the internet after setup</li>
        <li>A device with a built-in camera is recommended for QR code functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Critical Air-Gap Requirement</h2>
    <p>The chosen device must remain perpetually air-gapped. The app includes built-in safeguards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Continuous checks for online status</li>
        <li>Immediate warning if an online connection is detected</li>
        <li>Automatic disabling of sensitive functions and clearing of stored data if online</li>
    </ul>    <h2>Data Management Procedures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Input: Manual entry or transfer via QR codes</li>
        <li>Data Access: Directly on the offline device</li>
        <li>Data Export: Via QR codes or other secure, offline transfer methods</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Long-Term Storage and Distribution Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Securely delete data from the creation device after generating QR codes</li>
        <li>Distribute encrypted QR codes to multiple secure locations</li>
        <li>Security relies on three user-known dependencies: master password, custom pepper, and 2FA code</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physical Backup Options</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Laser etching on metal cards (approx. $10 USD per card)</li>
        <li>Use of online etching services</li>
        <li>Personal laser engraver option (around $100 USD)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Benefits</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Air-gap Security</li>
        <li>Malware Resistance</li>
        <li>Physical Security</li>
        <li>Versatility</li>
        <li>Redundancy</li>
        <li>Device Independence</li>
        <li>Disposable Hardware</li>
        <li>Physical Durability</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Price Comparison and Advantages</h2>
    <p>Expected to be priced between $100 and $200 USD (final price not yet decided).</p>
    <p>Advantages over traditional hardware wallets:</p>
