Only use the laser engraver with proper safety gear. Ensure you are in a well-ventilated room, preferably with an exhaust system.
</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Small desktop cube-shaped engravers are available</li>
                <li>Approximate dimensions: 20cm x 20cm x 20cm (7.9in x 7.9in x 7.9in)</li>
                <li>Starting price: around $100 USD</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Metal card engraving (estimated cost: $10 USD per card)</li>
        <li>Standard paper printing (most economical option, though less durable)</li>
        <li>Utilizing online engraving services (least recommended due to potential exposure)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These methods offer a range of durability and cost options, allowing users to choose the most suitable backup strategy for their needs. Users are responsible for selecting and implementing their preferred backup method.</p>
    <p>It's crucial to note that any unnecessary exposure of the QR code increases security risks. Therefore, the personal laser engraver option is highly recommended as it maintains the air-gapped integrity of the system.</p>
    <p>For online engraving services or any method involving digital transfer, users should exercise extreme caution. If such methods are absolutely necessary, users should transfer the encrypted QR code to a USB stick and use a different computer or device to access the service. However, this approach introduces additional security risks and should be avoided if possible.</p>
    <p>Remember, the security of the system relies heavily on minimizing exposure of sensitive data. The safest approach is to keep all processes entirely offline and under your direct control.</p>
